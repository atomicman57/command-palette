- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): NodeJS is a server-side JavaScript runtime engine built 
on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is lightweight, efficient and greatly used in building 
web apps. Please visit [this link](https://nodejs.org) for more details.

- [Sass/Scss](http://sass-lang.com/): Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.
